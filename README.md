# Nvidia-final-project: Forestfire AI
Forest fires are a significant threat to the environment, wildlife, and human lives, causing substantial damage and destruction. However, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) can help prevent and mitigate the damage caused by forest fires. This project can recognize fire in an image using detectnet and help stop the wildfires occurring in the forests and jungles.
By leveraging the power of AI, we can improve our ability to prevent and manage forest fires, ultimately helping to preserve our natural resources and protect the lives and property of people living in fire-prone areas.

Directions: With your Jetson Nano, you can upload the Forestfire AI script into your jetson-inference. With imagenet setup with the code, load your desired image within network and get an image classification. This image classifcation is stored into a dictionary database that can be accessed via the database_print code.

Imagenet: The imageNet object accepts an input image and outputs the probability for each class. Having been trained on the ImageNet dataset, the GoogleNet and ResNet-18 models were also downloaded.
